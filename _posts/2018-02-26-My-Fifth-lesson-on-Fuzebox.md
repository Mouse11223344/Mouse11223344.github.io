  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well as usual we used the booklets a lot and this time I also read the notes in between each of the paragraphs and that really helped with the understanding on how the code worked. We also got the computers working very quickly today so we were able to make excellent progress with completing the exercises. Other than that it was just a normal lesson and nothing went drastically wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well nothing really went that bad however the habit I think I need to work on is concentrating on my work for a long time but it is getting a bit boring doing the same thing over and over again as we do with each lesson. There isn't really anything new to do. I guess there was one thing that limited my learning and that’s the fact that I need to understand the code when writing it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the fact that over all the lessons I haven’t really been looking at the bottom notes in the booklet and those actually give you really helpful pointers and tips that I could used but at least now I understand what I’m programing more and how to do more advanced versions of it. I don’t think I would want to change much for today’s lesson as it went really well, a lot better than the last one.</td>
