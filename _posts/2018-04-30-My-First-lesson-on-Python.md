    <td>Since we were starting a new topic the best way I learnt was mostly by using the knowledge I already knew about programming and then combining that with common sense. The lesson on FuzeBox did help a bit when coding Python however it didn't do that much as Python is a completely different coding language to Fuzebox. Every time I got stuck I would ask myself where do I think I’ve gone wrong and if I was really stuck I would then look at the hints and ips but I only had to do that once.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There wasn’t much that limited my working accept the fact that I missed the previous lesson due to illness and forgot to catch up so in the case of which habits I need to work on, that would probably to remember to catch up on all the subjects I missed during those few days of illness. Not much else went wrong and overall I made some really good progress on my own. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing I’ll change for next time is the fact that I would have been there for the first lesson as that would have really helped as I would of got a good understanding of what I was doing, I'd be able to do my work more efficiently in the class and I would not have wasted about 5 minutes of the time at the beginning of the lesson, when Mr.Keen was explaining to me what we were doing.</td>
