    <td>Not relying on the solution was a really good way that I learnt because it meant that I not only got through the course by myself and I felt proud about that but I was also able to learn better because i was doing it myself however I still used the hints every now and then if I was really stuck in which case I'd still feel fine.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This time there wasn’t much that limited my learning except that I was talking to Mr Keen for around 15 mins of the lesson and in that I could have been doing a lot more work but it’s ok. Other than that I was ok with how much work I got done but I was really happy with the quality of my work as I stated before.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Honestly there wouldn’t be much that I change for this lesson as it went quite smoothly and I was still able to make a decent amount of work done even though I had that talk with Mr Keen. Overall I wouldn’t change much in this lesson and I would like to have lessons like this in the future.</td>
