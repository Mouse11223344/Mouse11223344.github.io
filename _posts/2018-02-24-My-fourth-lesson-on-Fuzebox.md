    <td>Well we always used the book to help us, which is our usual way of learning however today we didn't get that much learning done because we were constantly having to change computers or Fuze Boxes because nothing seemed to work when we tried to plug in. There was another thing I learnt, which was how to upload my USB stick onto another Fuze Box simultaneously with the computer but I wasn’t very pleased with my overall learning today.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well, the main thing that meant we couldn’t really learn anything was the fact that the computers we used or the Fuze Boxes we used didn’t actually work when we tried. We did check with Mr Ampah Korsah and he said that we set it up correctly however the computer didn’t have any HDMI cable so it wouldn’t work. I guess the habit I need to work on is if I know I’m just guessing at how to fix it go to the teacher.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will go to the teacher as soon as I realised there was something very wrong about this computer. I would also change the fact that the computers didn’t work but for the final 10 mins Mr Keen gave us a HDMI cable and we were able to do a bit of work so it’s not all bad. I’ll improve my learning by making the best of the 10 mins that I was lucky enough to get instead of just letting my partner do all the work because I was bored. I should have also joined another group.</td>
