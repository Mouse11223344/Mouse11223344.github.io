    <td>Like I did last week I didn't rely so much on the instructions and I figured out almost all of it without using the hint so that was good. I also didn’t have any distractions in this lesson and I was able to get to work really quick and then do it more efficiently as I wasn’t getting into any sort of conversation. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>On this lesson as well nothing really limited my learning and besides the little mishap I had at the beginning of the lesson with the wifi and the fact I couldn’t get onto codecademy. I was also very good with not starting a conversation as I mentioned before so nothing really limited my learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>And also as the same as last week there isn’t much that I would change for this lesson as there wasn’t much that went wrong. I achieved my target and I didn’t get into any conversations and I got on with the work early on so overall it was a very smooth lesson.</td>
