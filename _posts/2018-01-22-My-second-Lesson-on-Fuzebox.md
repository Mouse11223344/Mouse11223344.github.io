    <td>The booklet again was the best way that I learnt, it has everything that we really need and it's also very reliable. There was another way that I learnt though. It was by looking at the code and trying to figure out what it would do before it actually happened and also why it did that. I actually made sufficient progress this way and I intend to do it all the time. I also went to IT club straight after the lesson and made some more great progress on my blog by adding and customizing a table.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson, not much limited my learning actually. I did almost everything I could and also got a lot of work done since we did lose all our progress last time we did this. My partner’s USB stick didn’t seem to register with the machine so that was annoying. We could only save the work on one USB stick but that’s still ok it’s just not as secure as it could be. I did still have pictures and things on my USB stick so next time I think I’ll get rid of those and just have the USB stick. Other than that it went pretty well.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the fact that I had Images and information on my USB stick but those have been cleared now and there’s no problem, I still have my work. I think also if my partner bought a different USB stick that he could save our onto next lesson that would a lot more reassuring for me. I think that in the lesson I already improved my learning above the others and have started to read and understand the code that I’m writing and not just writing it and then looking at the book for help and guidance. Overall I think I did really well. </td>
