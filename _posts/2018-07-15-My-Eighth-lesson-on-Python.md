  <tr>
    <td>The way I learn was by the side window and because I've been doing Python for a while now I know pretty well how to sort out the code and the functions by myself so I mostly used my own knowledge to sort out the problems.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson nothing really limited my learning besides the fact that I didn’t get as much as I should have got done because I was taking things slowly and I didn’t want to get stuck on one particular part for so long so I took time to figure it out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I won't change much for next time besides the fact that I should work a bit faster because that’ll really help how much I can get done throughout the lesson and the lesson is the main  source of coding time I get.</td>
  </tr>
