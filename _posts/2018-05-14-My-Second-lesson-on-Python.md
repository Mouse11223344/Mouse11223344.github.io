  <tr>
    <td>The way I learn was by using the instructions on the side of each level. This would allow me to be able to do each stage easily. Sometimes however the instructions were a bit vague and they were difficult to follow, in which case I would have to use my own knowledge which I almost always eventually got right.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was the vagueness of the instructions. I believe that if they were a bit more clearer then I would have been able to work more effectively and complete the course a lot quicker. However this does make me use my own mind which is good.</td>

    <td>The things that I'll change for next time are the vagueness of the instructions that’ll allow me to work more effectively and then I’ll also change the way I approach these problems as they are starting to get harder. </td>
