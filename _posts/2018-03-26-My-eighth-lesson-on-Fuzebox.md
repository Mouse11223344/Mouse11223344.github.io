  <tr>
    <td>I used the booklet which is always our main source of information however this time I used the internet as well. There was a question that I wanted answering about Fuze so I looked it up and then went from there. This was a very effective strategy for me and I'm pretty sure I’ll use it a lot for often in the future. There isn’t many other strategies that I used this half term because we always did the same thing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that did limit my learning was that I didn’t get enough work done in the lesson because I kept messing up on writing the bits of code out and we had to re do one of the bits of code around 3 times because I just couldn’t get it right. I also was working with a different person which I shouldn’t have been doing. Overall it wasn’t a great end to the term but it could have been worse.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will work with my partner next time and I’ll also get my coding write on the first time and not miss out any lines by accident. This will help me to be more fluent when I’m coding and then I’ll be able to get more done. I wasn’t really that quick when setting up so in the future I would be more careful as to which of the plugs I pulled out so I don’t shutdown the computer as this was the cause of why we didn’t get started quick enough.</td>
