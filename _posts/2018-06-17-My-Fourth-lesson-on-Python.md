  <tr>
    <td>The way I learnt was by my own knowledge as I have been looking at coding books for a bit and I'm now starting to get a lot quicker and more efficient with my coding and I wasn’t doing what I did last week which was getting a bit lazy and then just going straight to the solution instead of figuring it out myself.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was the fact that for 40 mins of the lesson I was talking to Mr Keen about our projects that we are doing at home and we talked about some other things about general world politics, which was fun but I wasn’t getting any of the work done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing I’ll change for next time is that I’ll talk to Mr Keen for less of the lesson and then I can also get on with the work and also have the conversations with Mr Keen. I’ll do this by making sure that I’ll bring the conversation to an end or I'll just go and do the work by myself if other people are involved as well.</td>
