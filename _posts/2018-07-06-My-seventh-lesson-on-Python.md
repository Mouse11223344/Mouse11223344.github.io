    <td>Fortunately this week I got a lot more work than I've done in many other previous weeks and I worked really hard to complete the stages which I did then I finished off the others for homework.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The big fact that limited my learning was the fact that I was just getting really frustrated with the code and I just wasn’t doing something right so I eventually just skipped through to the results which I know is bad but I just wanted it to be done.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I won't try and do so much in the lesson so then I can be more relaxed at home, not stressed about homework and overall I’ll just be a lot calmer and I won't be forced into pressing the skip button because I’m so stressed out.</td>
