    <td>The way I learnt was by the instructions on the side of each activity that show up to help you do the work. I used these very effectively as I looked at the beginning of the text up in the corner and then I tried to figure out what to do which really sped up my time of doing each of the exercises. This then allowed me to get more done and then learn more.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing I'll change for next time is that I was getting a bit lazy with my working as I started yo just go straight to the solution instead of figuring it out, this then lead me to not learn as much and then i sort of got into the habit of doing this for the first few levels of the exercises however I soon got out of this habit and was able to normally continue my work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will change for next time the fact that I was feeling a bit lazy, I shouldn’t have been and I don’t think it’ll happen again. I also would have loved to know about the first lesson as it would have helped me learn more and quicker and get more of the work done.</td>
