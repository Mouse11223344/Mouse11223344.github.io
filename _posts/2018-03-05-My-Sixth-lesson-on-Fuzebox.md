  <tr>
    <td>Of course this time as usual we learned from the booklet and we were able to get significant work done. At one point since we are a bit behind my partner and I agreed that I should just copy a bit of the code down by myself and so we did that however not for very long as this would have affected his learning. The strategy that we both used well was listening and agreement because we were able to make great progress and get a lot further.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that did limit my learning was the fact that we were so far behind because of difficulties with the Fuze boxes and just the fact we were trying to do it quickly but it isn't easy for us. Since we made good progress in this lesson though we are able to move forward onto the end of stage 1 and then move onto stage 2 so overall it’s going fine now and I think we are going to get further in the next lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing I’ll change for next time is the fact that we did have to change computer once to get the Fuze working and we did have a bit of trouble with saving our work however that just ended up being that we were not saving the file in the correct USB file s we couldn’t access but that’s all fixed now. There isn't much else I would change for this lesson I think it went really well. Also MR Ampah korsah wasn’t here for this lesson so he didn’t actually see our progress.</td>
