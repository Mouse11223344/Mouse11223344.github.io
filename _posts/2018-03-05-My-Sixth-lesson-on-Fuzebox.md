  <tr>
    <td>The problem with learning on this lesson is that we didn't do anything really. What happened was the Monitor never seemed to be able to connect to the Fuze box. Every time it just said that there was no HTML signal and then we had to keep changing monitor’s and we were never able to get started. We were then told off for not doing the work but we were trying the whole lesson. It just didn’t work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well everything limited my learning this lesson as the Fuze box just didn’t respond to anything we did. We checked with a lot of other people working near us and we did have the exact same setup than them. After changing computer's many times we went to Mr Ampakorsa and even he didn’t manage to get it fixed. We even got a new HTML cable and that still didn’t work and we even changed Fuze boxes. I don’t know what was wrong with it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the fact that the Fuze box didn’t work as this is the 2nd time it has happened and it hasn’t been our fault, this is also hindering our working and we’re not able to make much good progress with our learning. We were also blamed for not setting up quick enough but we were honestly trying as hard as we could and we were doing everything we knew. It just didn’t seem to work out for us.</td>
