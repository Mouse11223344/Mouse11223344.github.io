    <td>The booklet was the main way that all of us learnt as it contains everything we need. I found that reading the booklet then switching to coding on the monitor with your partner, that was very effective and a good way of learning. When I was confused I just kept reading on in the book and it always eventually provided me with the answer which was very useful to have. Lastly I thought that a really effective strategy I did was figuring it out for myself and not just going straight to the teacher.</td>

    <td>The main thing that limited my learning was the fact that I completely forgot to save our work onto our USB stick. Sadness. We did lose all our work but on the bright side we do get to do it all again s and I did really enjoy it. The habit I need to work is actually remembering to save my work onto the USB stick and also being able to copy and paste it onto the stick otherwise it won't be much help. Luckily I wasn’t the only group that completely messed up and lost all their work.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the fact that I didn’t remember to save my work because now I’m going to be behind next lesson. We also didn’t use much common sense when actually setting up the Fuze box and it did take me 2 attempts to get it right but I did. Other than that I think I did pretty good and we did make some significant progress even though we lost it all. I hope next lesson will be a bit better in that sense.</td>
