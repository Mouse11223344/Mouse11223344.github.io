    <td>As usual we learnt from the booklet and it was of course very useful. This time it was even more useful as with the project roundup we had to do everything we had covered in the lessons before this and we could flick back through the pages to help us. We also managed to get set up very quickly and overall we worked really hard to get half way through the round up as it's the longest of all the stages in the whole booklet.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This time we did have to switch a few places before we could find a computer that worked so that definitely meant that we lost a bit of time however it was only about 2-3 minutes and we still got halfway through the roundup so it didn’t make much of a difference. I think we need to work on our coordination because we weren’t working together well as a team and that’s what we should have been doing.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The main thing I’ll change for next time is that little bit of time we lost at the beginning of the lesson just so we could get more work done. We also didn’t get our blogs checked because I don’t know why and I would have kind of wanted that to happen. Finally I think next lesson we’ll work on our teamwork and then my partner and I will be able to get the maximum amount of work that we can do done.</td>
